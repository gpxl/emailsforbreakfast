Alex Browne justifies his move from a dynamic site on Heroku to a static site on AWS by detailing performance improvements. But the REAL benefit in my opinion is here:
> As for the price? Well over the course of testing I probably sent more than one million requests to the CloudFront servers and transferred around a gigabyte of data. According to the pricing charts, this will cost me a measly single dollar. Not bad at all, especially considering thatâ€™s far more traffic than I expect to get in a typical month.
The bigger benefit is dropping costs from $35/mo. for a minimally sufficient Heroku Dyno to less than $1/mo. on bare AWS. I plan on replicating his efforts and detailing my own experience in a future post.
