Wonderful story of designing within constraints.

> The engineering brief was to build a remote controlled vehicle out of Dyson Balls and a few spare parts found in Dysonâ€™s research, design and development department.
>
>  Our team all had ideas around the engineering behind our vehicle but what led the design was the materials that were available. Our overall philosophy was robustness through simplicity so that there would be fewer points of failure and less chance of problems.
