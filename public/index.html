  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It&#8217;s been one month since <a href="http://www.gerlandopiro.com/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">I challenged myself</a> to launch a product with the goal of generating $5 in profit. I&#8217;m still in the research and planning phase, but I&#8217;ve already learned a valuable lesson for making progress in the early days of a new product.</p>

<h2>Share Early</h2>

<p>I have never had a hard time discussing product ideas with friends and colleagues, but when it came to soliciting feedback on my web app challenge I hesitated. My idea wasn&#8217;t fully fleshed out and I was worried I would be bothering people I respected with a half baked idea.</p>

<p>Regardless, I asked a few friends and colleagues to review my product idea and tried to validate the pain point I was trying to address. It only took a few conversations to realize that I needed improvement in how I communicated what the product did and what value it provided.</p>

<p>The great thing is that a few people stuck it through and helped  me iterate until my messaging was much stronger. Now I have a product pitch almost ready to test against a larger audience, but even more valuable are the connections I&#8217;ve strengthened with people I trust.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Ever since I was a kid I have found communication difficult. I avoid picking up phone calls from unknown numbers and I stumble over words when talking with friends as I am constantly searching for the right way to say something <em>while I&#8217;m in the middle of saying it!</em> Now that I&#8217;m making an effort to document <a href="/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">my experience building a web app</a>, it&#8217;s become clear that writing is a wonderful outlet for improving confidence in communicating and overcoming introversion.</p>

<p>In his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a></em>, author Dr. Cialdini outlines six weapons of influence that are commonly used to create desired outcomes in their targets. These &#8220;weapons&#8221; trigger desired reactions due to cultural and social norms that subtly control our decision making habits. One such weapon, commitment and consistency, is described with the observation, &#8220;Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.&#8221; That is, once we have made a decision or taken action, we are predisposed to maintain that direction or ideal. Writing about an idea triggers creates and internal commitment and a need for consistency regardless of wether or not you believe what is written.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this behavior was used to great effect in World War II to gather secret information from American POWs held in China. Rather than torture and threaten their prisoners, the Chinese army would persuade them to write a statement that sympathized with China&#8217;s world view. This simple act of writing an idea down, an act of compliance, triggered a commitment to the idea. The need for consistency ensured that subsequent requests for compliance were accepted with greater and greater ease to the point where POWs freely shared military secrets with their enemy.</p>

<p>If commitment and consistency can have such a strong effect on American POWs, imagine what it could do if applied for self-betterment. It&#8217;s no accident that the very first post to this blog was a declaration of intent, to create a revenue generating web application. The act of writing and committing to an idea is a strong trigger and sharing that idea publicly deepens the commitment. Once that is achieved, the consistency principle ensures the need for follow through.</p>

<p>Overcoming introversion is difficult, but writing can be a powerful tool for self motivation. So take a stand on something, write it down, and share it with others. You may be surprised at the results.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome to create a service that would make it easy for anyone to easily sell digital goods online? That&#8217;s the thought that motivated me to start the <a href="/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">$5 Web App Challenge</a>. But as I researched the market, doubt crept in. The ease with which a web application can be wrapped around <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>&#8217;s payment api has already caused a mini boom in such services. With established players such as <a href="https://gumroad.com">GumRoad</a>, <a href="https://sellfy.com">Sellfy</a>, <a href="https://spacebox.io">Space Box</a>, and numerous others quickly crowding the space I began to wonderâ€¦ do we really need another Stripe checkout app?</p>

<p>The appeal of creating such a site is strong as it fits a number of criteria I was looking towards when envisioning an app. The heavy lifting, payment processing, is off loaded to a third party. The MVP for the app is very narrow in scope. The market opportunity has been validated by the funding and competition already in the space. And there is clearly a need for such services in the number of <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/QVGo">high</a> <a href="https://sellfy.com/p/5ct4">profile</a> <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/DesigningWebApplications">creatives</a> already using them.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s not all unicorns and rainbows. The fees charged in this niche are extremely low, 1-2% per transaction (on top of Stripe&#8217;s 2.9% + $0.30 fee). A back of the napkin calculation shows that a run rate of nearly $2.5-5M is required to earn $50k/yr. With little to differentiate each other it will be difficult for any one service to charge a higher fee. That being the case, I would expect funded companies in this group to build their own payment systems to capture the 2.9% currently going to Stripe while continuing to target the general market for growth. The smaller players will need to go niche in an attempt to raise fees.</p>

<p>So no, the world does not need another Stripe landing page service, at least not one by me! Accepting this was tough as it set me back to square one with no idea of where to start. But doing so allowed new and better ideas to grow.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As I alluded to in my <a href="/2013/01/27/starting-the-5-dollars-web-app-challenge">$5 Web App Challenge</a> post, I have not been an active writer in the past. In years past, I&#8217;ve tried nearmly every blogging platform available; from hosted platforms like Blogger and Tumblr, to self hosted apps like Drupal and WordPress. Nothing seemed to click and I&#8217;d find myself <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a> instead of writing. Every time I would get frustrated and lose inspiration and motivation. The solution, I found recently, was to embrace constraints and simplify.</p>

<p>My current &#8220;blogging stack&#8221; consists of IA Writer, Octopress, and Amazon S3. It&#8217;s a developer friendly set up so non-techies might have to learn new tricks, but learning how to DIY is in itself very rewarding. In this post break down how each layer in the stack helps me work faster, run cheaper, and stay focused on writing.</p>

<h3>The Editor: IA Writer</h3>

<p>The biggest improvement in my ability to write has been finding an editor that suited me well. <a href="http://www.iawriter.com">IA Writer</a> is a wonderfully simple iOS and OSX text editor built for the sole purpose of distraction free writing. The application has practically no chrome and few features, but the features it <em>does</em> have are extremely handy. First off is <strong>focus mode</strong>, this feature allows you to focus on the current sentence by greying out all surrounding text. Files can be saved to iCloud you can write and edit on either iOS or OSX whenever inspiration hits. The iOS version adds special keys to ease navigating through documents by word or character.</p>

<p>Most important in my mind is that IA Writer supports <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview">Markdown formatted documents</a>. This last feature is pretty awesome as the blog software I use, Octopress, also supports Markdown. This shared feature means you can easily cut and paste documents into an Octopress file or <em>edit your Octopress files directly with IA Writer</em>. IA Writer has a preview window so you can be sure your Markdown renders as you expect it to.</p>

<h3>The Blog: Octopress</h3>

<p>In keeping with the theme of simplicity, I prefer <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> as my blogging platform. Most blog platforms, such as Wordpress, are delivered as web applications. In contrast, Octopress is a static file compiler that generates your entire site on your local computer <em>before</em> pushing to a web server. Octopress does not require a web application to deliver or manage content and as such, benefits from better security, faster response times, and much lower web server requirements.</p>

<p>Octopress posts are simple text files that can be formatted with Markdown syntax and can be edited in any text editor. Site generation and web server deployment are managed through scripted Rake tasks.</p>

<p>Since the output of Octopress is static html and css, all you need is a web service that can handle static files, and that&#8217;s where Amazon S3 comes in.</p>

<h3>The Web Host: Amazon S3</h3>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> has an intentionally minimal feature set for storing and retrieving static content. It&#8217;s very robust and extremely cost efficient with rates currently at $0.095/mo. for a GB of storage and $0.01 per 10,000 GET requests which means you can run a pretty well trafficked site for only pennies a month. Amazon consistently improves service and prices in their efforts to dominate market share, so  S3&#8217;s value over time will only increase.</p>

<p>Octopress does not currently support deployments to S3 by default, but it&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/107">coming soon</a> and there are some <a href="http://www.jerome-bernard.com/blog/2011/08/20/quick-tip-for-easily-deploying-octopress-blog-on-amazon-cloudfront">good articles</a> on how to DIY it for the impatient.</p>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>My writing efforts are still in the nascent stage, but I&#8217;m confident I have finally have a set of tools that match my preferred way of working. Embracing constraints and using a few simple tools has allowed me to focus on the task of writing and to publish on a reliable, robust web host for pennies a month.</p>

    <p><strong>That&#8217;s not a typo in the title. I&#8217;m seriously challenging myself to pull in $5 in profit this year. Keep reading to hear why I consider this far from a trivial goal.</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working as a web developer at various startups since the late 90s, and for many years I&#8217;ve dreamt of creating and selling a product of my own. I consider my design and dev skills to be decent but to date I have failed to launch anything of substance to call my own.</p>

<p>The cause is certainly not from a lack of good role models. I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to work beside some wonderfully smart and ambitious people that have gone on to do, and continue to do, great things. I&#8217;ve followed the rise of people such as <a href="http://unicornfree.com">Amy Hoy</a> since her Rails cheat sheet days, and more recently <a href="http://nathanbarry.com">Nathan Barry</a> with his Designing Web Applications book.</p>

<p>The new year brought upon a good deal of introspection as I read through a couple of books on the Lean Startup Methodology and behavioral marketing. I came to realize that I&#8217;ve been focused on the wrong things when it comes to building products and I let fear of ridicule hold me back from sharing my thoughts and experiences.</p>

<p>A couple of timely posts about <a href="http://lesseverything.com/blog/archives/2013/01/24/fear-just-refocuses-itself-1">fear</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5119213">regret</a> have solidified my resolve to finally take action and launch something.</p>

<p>So taking a page from Nathan&#8217;s <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/starting-web-app-challenge">$5k Web App Challenge</a>, I&#8217;ve come up with a challenge that I like to call the $5 Web App Challenge. The goal of which is to create a product or service that generates $5 in profit by the end of the year.</p>

<p>It may sound like ridiculously low bar to set, but it will require me to complete three goals that have so far eluded me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying a target customer</li>
<li>Building an audience</li>
<li>Creating something people are willing to pay for</li>
</ul>


<p>I will be leaning (no pun intended) on the process outlined in Ash Maurya&#8217;s <a href="http://runninglean.co">Running Lean</a> as a starting point and intend to adjust accordingly as I figure out what does and does not work for me.</p>

<p>Additionally, I committing to writing about the experience along the way in the hopes that someone finds it useful and to improve my quality and confidence in public communication. If you&#8217;ve read this far down the page please use the links below to get in touch or to follow my progress.</p>
