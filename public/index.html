  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Browne justifies his move from a dynamic site on Heroku to a static site on AWS by detailing performance improvements. But the REAL benefit in my opinion is here:</p>

<blockquote><p>As for the price? Well over the course of testing I probably sent more than one million requests to the CloudFront servers and transferred around a gigabyte of data. According to the pricing charts, this will cost me a measly single dollar. Not bad at all, especially considering that’s far more traffic than I expect to get in a typical month.
The bigger benefit is dropping costs from $35/mo. for a minimally sufficient Heroku Dyno to less than $1/mo. on bare AWS. I plan on replicating his efforts and detailing my own experience in a future post.</p></blockquote>

<p>Instagram is Facebook&#8217;s golden goose that&#8217;s yet to lay a single egg. I would expect this reversal of terms to be temporary and for the next update to  terms to much have less straightforward language</p>

After collecting the data on a daily basis for a little while, I figured it might be nice to look at the changes over time, and that is when the OrgOrgChart animation began.”</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wonderful story of designing within constraints.</p>

<blockquote><p>The engineering brief was to build a remote controlled vehicle out of Dyson Balls and a few spare parts found in Dyson’s research, design and development department.</p>

<p> Our team all had ideas around the engineering behind our vehicle but what led the design was the materials that were available. Our overall philosophy was robustness through simplicity so that there would be fewer points of failure and less chance of problems.</p></blockquote>
