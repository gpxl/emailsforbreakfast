  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Old Guard</p>

<blockquote><p>They have a well-defined internal map of the different parts of the company that consist of the rest of the Old Guard.</p></blockquote>

<p>The New Guard</p>

<blockquote><p>These folks have arrived in the last year and while they understand that there is culture and there are values out there, they spend a lot of time confused about these topics because no one has taken the time to sit them down and explain them and the folks who are qualified to do so are busy keeping the ship pointed in the right direction.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Problem</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;the Old Guard can’t conceive of a universe where everyone doesn’t know everything, and they have difficulty explaining what they find obvious.</p></blockquote>

<p>Having been on both sides of this equation, I believe this issue could be effectively resolved through mentorship and collaboration but this requires the &#8220;Old Guard&#8221; to show a lot of empathy for the &#8220;New Guard&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago such an article from Forbes would have been unheard of.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;it’s entirely possible for there to come a point in a company’s lifetime when that wealth maximising strategy is simply to stop investing in the future. To quite simply say that instead of investing billions upon billions for the next thing the company is going to sell, the correct answer is to invest nothing and return all the profits to shareholders.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alex Browne justifies his move from a dynamic site on Heroku to a static site on AWS by detailing performance improvements. But the REAL benefit in my opinion is here:</p>

<blockquote><p>As for the price? Well over the course of testing I probably sent more than one million requests to the CloudFront servers and transferred around a gigabyte of data. According to the pricing charts, this will cost me a measly single dollar. Not bad at all, especially considering that’s far more traffic than I expect to get in a typical month.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bigger benefit is dropping costs from $35/mo. for a minimally sufficient Heroku Dyno to less than $1/mo. on bare AWS. I plan on replicating his efforts and detailing my own experience in a future post.</p>

<p>Instagram is Facebook&#8217;s golden goose that&#8217;s yet to lay a single egg. I would expect this reversal of terms to be temporary and for the next update to  terms to much have less straightforward language</p>

After collecting the data on a daily basis for a little while, I figured it might be nice to look at the changes over time, and that is when the OrgOrgChart animation began.”</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wonderful story of designing within constraints.</p>

<blockquote><p>The engineering brief was to build a remote controlled vehicle out of Dyson Balls and a few spare parts found in Dyson’s research, design and development department.</p>

<p> Our team all had ideas around the engineering behind our vehicle but what led the design was the materials that were available. Our overall philosophy was robustness through simplicity so that there would be fewer points of failure and less chance of problems.</p></blockquote>
